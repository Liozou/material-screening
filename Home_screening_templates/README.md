To use `sample`  type of simulation you need to have a directory called `Coordinates` containing the coordinates of the points you wan to sample (see `KAXQIL_clean.csv` as an example of format). The commas are replaced by spaces so it is not standard csv.

The coordinates are obtained from Zeo++ and gives the voronoi nodes for each structure (see `KAXQIL_clean.nt2` for the raw data that has been converted)
